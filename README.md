# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This Program is the classic hot/cold game using numbers. The program has 3 different settings: Standard, find a decimal number from 1 - 100, COLOR, find 3 decimal numbers from 0 - 255 
representing the RGB scale, HEX, find a hexidecimal number from 0 - FF.

The prupose of writing this software is to start my learning of the Java language.
